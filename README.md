Paired Lab, Bucketlist App - mongoDB, API, front end web submit.
# Lab: Bucket List

Create an application that allows the user to make a 'bucket list' of countries that they want to visit.

## MVP

Your app should:

- Use the RESTCountries API to populate a dropdown with countries
- Be able to persist a list of selected countries
- Display a list of the countries which have been added to the user's bucket list

## Possible Extensions

- Add more detail to the bucket list items - e.g. landmarks you want to visit or the season you want to visit in. Persist these to Mongo too.
- Add a Google Map with markers for countries on the bucket list
- Style the app

## Considerations

- Try to split your client-side code into models and views. Think about the responsibilities of each.
